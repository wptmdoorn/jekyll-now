Hello there! My name is William van Doorn. I am a PhD-candidate in the department of Clinical Chemistry at the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ (Maastricht, The Netherlands). I am passionate about clinical and laboratory research, but also highly interested in fundamental and translational machine learning. Here, I will write about recent (scientific) developments in the fields of clinical chemistry, machine learning and/or the combination of both.
